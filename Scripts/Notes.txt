Moving file from one directory to another:
mv /path/file.txt /path/folder

"less" can be used to view a file and you can give :n to move to next file,
:p to go back to the previous one, or :q to quit.

head -n 3 <file name> prints the first 3 lines of the text file.
tail -n 3 <filename> prints the last 3 lines of a file.

ls -R will list everything in a folder recursively in your home directory.
ls -R -F prints the entire paths with a /

cut -f 2-5, 8 -d -f means fields 2-5, 8 means columns 2-5 and 8. -d means delimiter.

"history" prints all the commands you entered using "!" and a specific index will run the last command.

Use the "!" with the said command to rerun the command.


    -c: print a count of matching lines rather than the lines themselves
    -h: do not print the names of files when searching multiple files
    -i: ignore case (e.g., treat "Regression" and "regression" as matches)
    -l: print the names of files that contain matches, not the matches
    -n: print line numbers for matching lines
    -v: invert the match, i.e., only show lines that don't match

"paste" combines files data and read it to you.
