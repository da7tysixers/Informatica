 Informatica Course:
 
 Informatica architecture is call service architecture.
 
 Domain is the foundation of the informatica architecture. It is the primary unit providing service for Informatica.
 Node: Nothing but a physical machine. Logical representation of a machine in a domain.
 
 Master gateway: Primary entry for client request.
 A service manager starts and execute services in a domain.
 
 Types of Nodes:
 - Worker Node
 - Gateway Node
 - Master Gateway Node

 Connecting to Oracle instances
 sys as sysdba
 then type: startup.
 proceed to log into the database of your choice.

 ===================================
 
 How do you use scripting to run a file.
 
 Can you use the Minus SQL query in Hive database?
 Top down bottom approach, top up bottom approach.
 
 OLAP:
 Roll-up - Summarize the database
 Drill-down - Reverse of Roll up
 Slice and dice - Project and select
 Pivot (rotate) - Re-orient the cube
 
 Expresssion transformation code to load flatfile concurrent with different names:
 'T_FF_Employees_'||TO_CHAR(SYSTIMESTAMP(),'MMDDYYYYHH24MISS')||'.CSV'
 
 Source Qualifier:
 ==================
 If the source is Flat file, all the properties will be disabled.
 Only tracing level will enabled.
 
 
 Types of thread in session log:
 Reader thread
 Transformation thread
 Writer thread
 
 Selecting number of ports in properties orders the data by the number you select.
 If you select one only first column will select. if you select 3 it will take the first 3 columns.

 Left outer join in Oracle and Informatica. Just simply add the symbol (+) at the end of the
 other table join to perform
 EMPLOYEES.DEPARTMENT_ID=DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID
 
 
 ====
 FILTER TRANSFORMATION
 ========
 Filter transformation is used to filter out records any where in the pipeline
 
Expression Transformation
First_name to upper case upper(first_name)

last_name adding string '_'  '_'||last_name

email adding @gmail.com if salary is greater than 10000
IIF(SALARY > 10000,EMAIL||'@gmail.com',EMAIL||'@yahoo.com')


phone number removing some string use the replacechar which takes integer as argument
'+1'||replacechr(0,PHONE_NUMBER,'.','') Replacing with nothing. number 555.003 to 555003

Hire_date leap year:
IIF(MOD(GET_DATE_PART(HIRE_DATE,'YYYY'),4)=0,'Leap','None leap year')

Reading data from an Excel
==========================
First create  (ISM) Intelligence Structure model
To read rthe file you must have Structure Parser

Master Outer Join -- Right Join
Detailed Outer Join -- Left Join


Unconnected lookup transformation:
passing function: LKP.LKPTRANS(passing field)


What is the defference between cluster index and non cluster index
when loading a flat file to flat file and you want bottom record how do you know you are getting
the botton record? Informatica.

How do you check informatica log issue using script?
How do you load a file using informatica script?



Tracing level: The amount of details in the session log. define the amount 
of data you wish to write in the session log when you execute the workflow. 
The tracing level is a very important aspect of Informatica, as it helps in analyzing errors.

===============
Update Strategy
===============

An active, Connected
dd - data driven

dd_insert 0
dd_update 1
dd_delete 2        (Instead of delete, we will soft delete -- Inactive)
dd_reject 3

Target ---> Primary key

=============
SCD Types
=============
TYPE 1
MD5 is a function in informatica. Used to generate a hash value. Based on the hash
value we will compare the source data and target data and decide if we will go for update
or insert logic.

Type 1: No history will be maintained
		Simple update
		
TYPE 2
Type 2: History will be maintained
		Row level history
			Method - 1 - Flag
			Method - 2 Version
			Method - 3 Date
			
TYPE 3
Type 3: Recent history will be maintained
		Column level history
